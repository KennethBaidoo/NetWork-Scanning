# CyberSecurity Lab: Netork-Scanning
Scanning Live Host and Open ports to detect any breahces

Proficiently employed Nmap for host discovery, employing packet transmission to IP addresses to assess network responsiveness and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Executed a range of Nmap scans, including SYN, TCP, and UDP, to comprehensively identify live hosts and open ports, enhancing my ability to map network topologies.

Customized Nmap scans using its scripting engine to automate assessments, demonstrating adaptability and efficiency in pinpointing security weaknesses in services and systems.

Analyzed Nmap scan outputs with precision, utilizing advanced features to recognize irregular patterns and security risks, thereby contributing to robust network defense strategies.

Collaborated with the Try Hack Me community to share insights gained from Nmap scans, promoting a collective understanding of security concerns and solutions.

Leveraged Nmap in real-world scenarios to assess network robustness, ensuring that systems are fortified against potential cyber threats.

Demonstrated proficiency in Windows and Linux by executing network traceroutes, establishing remote communication channels and optimizing network performance.

Adapted Nmap techniques to evolving network security landscapes, reflecting a commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends.

Synthesized Nmap results into clear and actionable reports, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions to enhance network security posture.

Played an active role in utilizing Nmap as a foundational tool in the exploration of network vulnerabilities, solidifying my practical experience in ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
